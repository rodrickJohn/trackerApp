===================Welcome to trackerApp git repository=============================

The project was developed using Ionic framework. Development version was Ionic version 4.12.0, I do not anticipate issues with versions latter than this.

Setting up the environment
--------------------------
I found this to be a great link to start setting up your environment https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ionic/ionic_environment_setup.htm

Another tutorial that was used to set up communication with the back-end (using MongoDB) is here https://www.joshmorony.com/building-a-review-app-with-ionic-2-mongodb-node/

After environment is set be sure to run npm install after navigating to the server folder in this project.

Running npm install will get you started with all dependencies necessary for this project to launch and function in your environment.

You should do the same with npm install when inside the trackerApp folder to ensure you have all dependencies for the front end.

Note: You can help improve this README as deemed necessary.

Thank you!
